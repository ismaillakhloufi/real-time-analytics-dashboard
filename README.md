# üìä Real-Time Analytics Dashboard with Apache Kafka and Spark

![Dashboard Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400)  
*Real-time data processing and visualization pipeline for actionable insights.*

---

## üìã Project Overview
This project is a **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard** that leverages **Apache Kafka** and **Apache Spark** to process live data streams. With real-time data ingestion, processing, and visualization, the project provides immediate insights through a dynamic dashboard (built with **Plotly** or **Dash**).

Use cases include:
- **Stock Price Monitoring**: Analyzing price trends.
- **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**: Tracking popular hashtags and keywords.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components
### 1. Data Ingestion with Apache Kafka
- **Kafka** manages the data pipeline by ingesting and distributing real-time data from sources like APIs or social media.
- Kafka producers push data into a topic, while consumers retrieve it for processing.

### 2. Real-Time Data Processing with Apache Spark
- **Spark Streaming** enables continuous computation of data received from Kafka.
- Example tasks include:
  - Calculating moving averages for stock prices.
  - Counting hashtag usage over a specified time window.

### 3. Live Dashboard Visualization
- The dashboard is created using **Plotly** or **Dash** and provides:
  - **Line charts** for real-time trend monitoring.
  - **Word clouds** for visualizing popular hashtags.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker** (for Kafka and Zookeeper containers)
- **Python** and **pip** (for running Spark jobs and the dashboard)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-analytics-dashboard.git
   cd real-time-analytics-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set Up Kafka and Zookeeper with Docker**  
   Start Kafka and Zookeeper by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   > *Check the `docker/` directory for Docker configuration details.*

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Spark Job**  
   Run the Spark streaming job to begin processing data:
   ```bash
   spark-submit data_processing/streaming_job.py
   ```

5. **Launch the Dashboard**  
   Start the dashboard to visualize the processed data:
   ```bash
   python dashboard/app.py
   ```
   Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8050`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Tips

- **Handling Data Loss**: Enable Kafka‚Äôs built-in fault-tolerance features and Spark checkpointing for data recovery.
- **Scaling**: For larger datasets, consider adjusting Kafka partitions and Spark configurations or using a sample dataset for demonstration.

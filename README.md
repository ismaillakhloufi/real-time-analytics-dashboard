## üìã Project Overview
This project is a **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard** that leverages **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, **InfluxDB**, and **Grafana** to process live data streams. With real-time data ingestion, processing, and visualization, the project provides immediate insights through a dynamic dashboard.

### Use Cases:
- **Stock Price Monitoring**: Analyzing price trends in real-time.
- **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**: Tracking popular hashtags and keywords over time.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Components
### 1. Data Ingestion with Apache Kafka
- **Kafka** manages the data pipeline by ingesting and distributing real-time data from sources like APIs or social media.
- Kafka producers push data into a topic, while consumers retrieve it for processing.

### 2. Real-Time Data Processing with Apache Spark
- **Spark Streaming** enables continuous computation of data received from Kafka.
- Example tasks include:
  - Calculating moving averages for stock prices.
  - Counting hashtag usage over specified time windows.

### 3. Data Storage with InfluxDB
- **InfluxDB** is used to store time-series data processed by Spark, allowing for efficient queries and analysis of data over time.
- It supports high write rates and is optimized for time-series data.

### 4. Live Dashboard Visualization with Grafana
- The dashboard is created using **Grafana** to visualize the processed data stored in InfluxDB.
- It provides:
  - **Line charts** for real-time trend monitoring of stock prices.
  - **Dynamic panels** to visualize the frequency of trending hashtags.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Docker** (for Kafka, Zookeeper, and InfluxDB containers)
- **Python** and **pip** (for running Spark jobs)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-analytics-dashboard.git
   cd real-time-analytics-dashboard
   ```

2. **Set Up Kafka, Zookeeper, and InfluxDB with Docker**  
   Start Kafka, Zookeeper, and InfluxDB by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   > *Check the `docker/` directory for Docker configuration details.*

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Spark Job**  
   Run the Spark streaming job to begin processing data:
   ```bash
   spark-submit data_processing/streaming_job.py
   ```

5. **Launch Grafana**  
   Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` and configure it to read data from InfluxDB.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Tips

- **Handling Data Loss**: Enable Kafka‚Äôs built-in fault-tolerance features and Spark checkpointing for data recovery.
- **Scaling**: For larger datasets, consider adjusting Kafka partitions and Spark configurations or using a sample dataset for demonstration.

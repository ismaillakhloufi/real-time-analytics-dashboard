# real-time-analytics-dashboard
This project is a Real-Time Analytics Dashboard designed to process live data streams, such as stock prices or social media feeds, to provide immediate insights. The pipeline is built using Apache Kafka for data ingestion, Apache Spark for real-time processing, and a live dashboard (using Plotly or Dash) to visualize the results in real-time.
